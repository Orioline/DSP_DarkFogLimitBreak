# DarkFogLimitBreak

Dark Fog is breaking its limit! Be careful, Engineers!
You can start a new game with higher DarkFog initial level, as well as a few other settings.

## INSTRUCTIONS

Install this mod (BepinEx is required, of course), and when you starts a new game, you will see changes in darkFog combat settings.

### HINTS

However, the max level is still 30. (so you may remove this mod without crashing the game .. i hope so, but not that sure.)

Alerts: Experimental version - backup your saves!

This mod is inspired by "GetFogged" mod, but make configs more reasonable.

### UPDATE LOGS
Version 0.0.1: initial version, supports only initial max level and density limit break.
